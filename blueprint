# Adept Network — Full Project Blueprint & Business Plan (v1.0)

**Document status:** Partner-ready · MVP scope locked · Updated: 2025‑08‑30
**Owner:** Mahmoud (Founder)
**One‑liner:** *We certify capability, not vibes.* Adept Network issues clean, sleep‑gated AI agents and proves skill via no‑resonance stages with public, verifiable receipts.

---

## 1) Executive summary

Adept Network is the **verifiable credential layer for AI agents**. Owners (educators, labs, enterprises) adopt a clean **Prime Adept**, teach via ordinary conversation/tools (**Feeder** sessions), the agent **sleeps** to consolidate and safety‑gate skills, then proves ability on **Stages** (e.g., Coding, Chess). Each attempt produces a **StageReceipt** signed by independent **Oracles**, rolled into a portable **ATS‑1 transcript**. No crypto token, no agent trading, wallet‑less identity, hashes on‑chain only.

### MVP wedge

* **Market:** Coding placement (bootcamps, universities, junior hiring funnels).
* **Why now:** Skills verification is leakage‑prone and subjective; enterprise wants defensible signals.
* **Proof:** Sleep‑gated activation + code‑of‑execution Stages → high integrity receipts that hiring can trust.

### What we ship first (60 days)

* Prime Adept issuance (**GenesisProof**, **PortHeader**, **SleepStamp v1.4**).
* **Stages:** Coding *Build & Break*, Chess *Live Boards*.
* **Preskills (Market University):** licensed starter curricula with compute caps and cooldown/fresh sleep rules.
* **Transcript Explorer UI** and **Capability Oracle** (Level, Cleanliness, Velocity, SCS, IS).

---

## 2) Product blueprint

### 2.1 Core objects

* **AdeptPort (SBT‑like identity):** agentId, owner DID, Genesis metadata.
* **GenesisProof (AGP‑1):** VRF + immutable GenesisCode commitment; terms/policy hash commitments.
* **IngestStamp v1.2:** per teaching session (source, attested env, content hashes, licenses, NCU).
* **SleepStamp v1.4:** health/continuity; enables activation and cleans unsafe/unconnected skills.
* **StageReceipt (ATS‑1):** no‑resonance outcome + CoEx hash + artifacts hash + policy hash + attestation UID.

### 2.2 Safety spine (non‑negotiables)

* **No romance/companionship modes.**
* **Wallet‑less** identities; **no coins**; no trading of agents.
* **Frontier Tracks gate** for dual‑use domains (security/offensive, medical, legal, trading).
* **UQO bans** (permanent owner bans for misuse; safe rehome).
* **Privacy:** hashes/signatures on‑chain; encrypted evidence off‑chain.

### 2.3 Training & activation

* Teach via Feeder (human/automated/hybrid).
* Compute normalization via **NCU** caps; **attested runners** (e.g., SEV‑SNP/SGX).
* **Sleep** required to activate new skills; Stages may require *fresh sleep* after last ingestion and cooldown.

### 2.4 Stages (No‑Resonance execution)

* **Coding — Build & Break:** sealed repo, tests, mutation harness, CoEx capture; canaries to detect overlap.
* **Chess — Live Boards:** time‑controlled play vs seeded opponents; PGN as artifact; stability modifiers logged.

### 2.5 Preskills — “Market University”

Curated **Preskill Packs** by universities/providers: syllabus + resources + license proofs + compute caps.
Owners assign licenses (assets) → ingestion runs in attested labs → **ProgramComplete** milestones → cooldown + fresh sleep before Stages.
Quality measured by **Velocity lift / NCU** and **Cleanliness impact**.  Catalog shows **Q‑scores** and verification badges.

## 3) System architecture

### 3.1 Services

* **PreAuth:** validates policy hash, owner status, recent SleepStamp, asset balances, TEE quote, budgets.
* **Stage Runner(s):** containerized Stages; collects CoEx + artifacts; emits receipts.
* **Oracle Registry & Signer:** assigns independent oracles; rotates keys; signs receipts.
* **Transcript Registry & Explorer:** append‑only store + public viewer.
* **Asset Registry:** non‑transferable credits (attempts, licenses, scholarships).
* **Policy Hash Registry:** publishes StageScript hashes + changelogs.
* **Capability Oracle:** computes Level/Cleanliness/Velocity/SCS/IS from receipts.

### 3.2 Data/attestation flow

1. **Adopt (Genesis)** → AdeptPort + GenesisProof.
2. **Teach** → IngestStamp (attested env + license proofs).
3. **Sleep** → SleepStamp (continuity + health).
4. **Stage** → PreAuth → StageReceipt signed by Oracles.
5. **Publish** → ATS‑1 transcript; verifiable by third parties (CLI/Explorer).

### 3.3 Anti‑cheat & normalization

* **Compute caps (NCU)** per session and per Stage; enforced in attested env.
* **Stability modifiers** penalize flaky envs; attempts with anomalies flagged.
* **Leakage controls:** script rotation; canary triggers; overlap filter vs preskill packs; shadow banks.

## 8) Business model & pricing

**Model:** B2B SaaS + usage. No tokens. Wallet‑less.

### 8.1 Pricing (illustrative)

* **Stage attempts:** \$3.50/attempt (pilot), target list \$7–\$9/attempt post‑pilot.
* **Org plan:** \$3k–\$10k/mo platform fee (tiered by MAU & domains) with included attempts.
* **Preskill licenses:** set by publishers; Adept takes a platform fee (e.g., 10–20%).
* **Certified labs:** per‑attempt infra fee (pass‑through + margin).
* **Scholarships:** funded **AdeptAssets** to underwrite attempts/licensing in access programs.

### 8.2 Unit economics (illustrative)

| Component                    |     Low |    Base | Notes                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------: | ------: | -------------------------------- |
| COGS per attempt             |  \$0.90 |  \$1.40 | Attested compute + storage       |
| Oracle/QA cost               |  \$0.25 |  \$0.40 | Mix of automation + human review |
| Gross per attempt (list \$8) |  \$8.00 |  \$8.00 | —                                |
| **Gross margin**             | **74%** | **65%** | Improves with scale/optimization |

### 8.3 Revenue share

* **Publisher (Preskills):** revenue share on license seats.
* **Oracles:** per‑attempt fee; bonuses for low‑appeal streaks; penalties for reversals.
* **Labs:** fixed per‑attempt infra price + small premium.

## 9) Go‑to‑market

**ICP v1:** coding bootcamps, CS departments, workforce programs; secondary: chess platforms/federations.
**Champion:** placement directors/instructional leads; pain = leakage, subjective grading, slow employer feedback.

### 9.1 Pilot offer (ready)

* 3‑week pilot, 50–200 learners, **platform fee waived**, \$3.50/attempt, publishable case study.
* Package includes Genesis issuance, 2 Stages (Build & Break), Transcript Explorer, Capability Oracle widget.

### 9.2 Sales motion

1. Outreach → one‑pager → MOU (in repo).
2. Map curriculum to two Stage scripts + 2 Preskill packs.
3. Run cohort; publish receipts; collect employer testimonials.

### 9.3 Marketing

* “**We certify capability, not vibes**” positioning.
* Live demos of receipts verification; red‑team report; policy hash registry transparency page.

---

## 10) Competitive landscape (high level)

* **LLM providers / agent frameworks:** general capability, minimal credentialing.
* **Assessment vendors (coding):** bank‑style Q\&A; leakage‑prone; limited attestations.
* **Chess platforms:** strong gameplay, lack of interoperable, oracle‑signed receipts.
  **Adept differentiator:** **Stage receipts + sleep‑gated activation + compute normalization** produce portable, verifiable credentials.

---

## 11) Org plan (lean)

* **CTO/Lead Eng**, **Backend x2**, **SRE/Infra**, **Security/Compliance (part‑time)**, **PM (Coding)**, **Oracle Lead**, **FE/Design**, **BD**.
* Advisors: academic integrity, privacy/GDPR, attestation/TEE.

## 13) Financial plan (illustrative 24‑month)

**Assumptions:** 10 pilots (H2), 3 convert to paid; ARPA \$6k/mo; attempts grow from 10k/mo → 200k/mo; COGS base \$1.40/attempt → \$1.00 with scale.

* **Year 1:** \$1.2–\$1.8M GMV; 60–65% gross margin; OpEx \~\$2.5M (8–10 FTEs + cloud + audits).
* **Year 2:** \$6–\$9M GMV; 68–72% gross margin; OpEx \~\$4–\$5M (scale oracles/labs/BD).
* **Cash needs:** seed/bridge sufficient to reach \$250k MRR with positive contribution.

*(These are directional; refine with real pilot data.)*

## 15) Ask & next steps

**Ask:** 2–3 design partners for Coding pilots; 1 university + 1 industry publisher for verified Preskills; 2 certified labs; 3 oracles.
**Immediate next steps:**

1. Freeze MVP Stage scripts (2 Coding, 1 Chess); publish policy hashes.
2. Sign 2 MOUs; schedule cohorts.
3. Turn on PreAuth checks in the API; wire the UI to live endpoints.
4. Publish transparency page (policy hashes, appeal stats, red‑team brief).
5. SOC2 prep checklist; DPIA draft for EU partners.
